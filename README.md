**Natural Language Processing with Representation Learning**

This course will examine modern computational approaches based on representation learning for understanding, processing and using human language. These include neural network-based deep learning methods and vector-space models of word meaning, and together will give you the tools to build state-of-the-art models for hard language understanding tasks like translation.
